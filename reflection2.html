            <p>As I reflect on my journey through Modules 1-3, I can see how much I’ve grown both in terms of technical skills and overall confidence as an aspiring application system designer. Each module has provided me with new tools, insights, and strategies that have expanded my understanding of system design, usability, and the critical steps required to turn an idea into a fully functioning application.</p>

<p><strong>Key Learning Moments and Achievements</strong><br>
One of my most significant learning moments came during Module 1: Gathering and Analyzing Requirements. This module opened my eyes to the importance of requirements gathering as the foundation for any successful project. I learned to structure the process of eliciting requirements from stakeholders using methods like interviews, surveys, and observation. I also found the use of requirements analysis tools—such as use case diagrams and user stories—extremely valuable for mapping out user needs in a clear and structured way. This process allowed me to approach system design with a user-first mindset and clarified the importance of precise and well-documented requirements. One of my achievements here was successfully translating vague client input into specific, actionable requirements, something I had previously struggled with.</p>

<p>Moving into Module 2: Designing System Architecture, I developed a greater appreciation for the complexity and criticality of system architecture. This module taught me how to break down a system into its key components and design architecture that is both scalable and maintainable. I learned about different architectural styles such as client-server and microservices and how to select an architecture that best fits the project’s needs. My most significant achievement in this module was designing a scalable architecture for a hypothetical application, something I hadn’t done in detail before. It helped solidify my understanding of how systems work behind the scenes and how good architecture sets the foundation for both current and future growth.</p>

<p>Finally, Module 3: Designing User Experience and Conducting Usability Testing shifted my focus to the users. While I had some knowledge of user experience (UX) design prior to this course, this module helped me grasp how integral it is to overall system design. Learning how to create wireframes and prototypes with tools like Figma, and conducting usability testing to gather user feedback, taught me the importance of continuous iteration based on real-world data. My biggest takeaway from this module was the realization that user experience is not a one-time task; it's an ongoing process that must evolve as user needs and system capabilities change.</p>

<p><strong>Application of Concepts and Techniques</strong><br>
Throughout these modules, I have been able to apply many of the concepts and techniques to my own work. For example, in a personal project where I am designing a predictive maintenance system, I used the requirement gathering techniques from Module 1 to engage with potential users (maintenance engineers) and uncover key functionality they needed. In Module 2, I applied my knowledge of system architecture to design a scalable, microservices-based architecture for the application, ensuring it could grow with increasing user demand. The usability testing from Module 3 helped me validate the user interface (UI) design by conducting testing sessions and making iterative improvements based on user feedback. This hands-on application has reinforced the theoretical concepts from each module and improved my project outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges and Overcoming Obstacles</strong><br>
One of the main challenges I encountered was during Module 2, where I initially struggled with the complexity of designing a robust and scalable system architecture. My previous experience was more focused on front-end development, so diving into system architecture felt overwhelming at first. To overcome this, I broke the process down into smaller, more manageable tasks and reviewed real-world case studies, which helped me understand how to structure complex systems. I also found collaboration with peers and asking questions during discussions to be incredibly helpful in overcoming this challenge.</p>

<p>In Module 3, the biggest challenge was conducting effective usability testing. I initially underestimated how much preparation is required to ensure meaningful feedback from users. I learned that it’s essential to define clear usability metrics and prepare targeted tasks for testers to perform. After improving my process, I found the feedback to be much more actionable and was able to make important improvements to the user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Progress and Opportunities for Growth</strong><br>
I feel I have made the most progress in system architecture design. This was an area where I had little prior experience, and I now feel much more comfortable thinking about how systems are structured and ensuring they can scale effectively. I also feel more confident in usability testing—not just in gathering feedback but also in how to interpret it and incorporate it into design iterations.</p>

<p>However, I see opportunities for further growth in user experience design. While I now have a solid foundation in usability testing and wireframing, I believe there’s still room to grow in terms of mastering advanced UX principles and techniques for creating seamless user journeys. I plan to spend more time exploring different UX methodologies and learning more about accessibility design to ensure my applications are usable by all people, regardless of their abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Connections Between Topics</strong><br>
The connections between the topics covered in Modules 1-3 have been apparent throughout the course. Gathering requirements in Module 1 laid the groundwork for both system architecture design and user experience design. Without a clear understanding of user needs, it would be impossible to create a robust system architecture or an intuitive user experience. Similarly, the work on system architecture in Module 2 was directly linked to the UX design in Module 3—an efficient system architecture improves user experience by ensuring smooth, fast, and reliable performance. These connections have reinforced my understanding that application system design is a holistic process, where each stage influences the next, and that a good designer must balance technical performance with user satisfaction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, these three modules have helped me grow in ways I did not anticipate. I now have a much clearer understanding of what it takes to design and develop applications that are technically sound and user-friendly. Moving forward, I look forward to continuing to refine these skills and applying them to increasingly complex projects.</p>
